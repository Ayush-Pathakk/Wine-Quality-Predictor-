# Wine Quality Classification Engine (WQC v1.0)

## Executive Summary: Product and Business Value

The Wine Quality Classification (WQC) v1.0 is our initial machine learning model designed to rapidly and objectively assess the quality of red wine based on chemical attributes. This tool is built to support critical business functions, including automated quality control, inventory pricing, and identifying batches suitable for premium markets.

The core innovation lies in converting the subjective, multi-point quality scale (3-8) into a **binary classification system** ("Good" vs. "Bad") that directly aligns with commercial decision-making.

## Technical Architecture and Data Strategy

| Component | Technology / Technique | Rationale (Director of Data Science) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Model Selection** | **Random Forest Classifier** | Chosen as a high-performance, non-linear ensemble model. It excels at handling complex relationships in chemical feature data and is robust against noisy data, ensuring high predictive accuracy out-of-the-box. |
| **Target Variable Definition** | **Label Binarization** | The quality score is simplified: $Q \geq 7$ is classified as **Good (1)**, and $Q < 7$ is classified as **Bad (0)**. This redefines the problem to directly answer the business question: "Is this wine premium-grade?" |
| **Data Visualization** | Correlation Heatmap & Bar Plots | EDA confirmed intuitive chemical relationships (e.g., lower `volatile acidity` correlates with better quality). This visual validation ensures model feature importance aligns with domain knowledge. |
| **Feature Set** | 11 physicochemical features (e.g., Fixed Acidity, pH, Alcohol) | The model is trained purely on objective chemical metrics, minimizing human bias and ensuring replicable results across different testing facilities. |

## Current Performance Snapshot

The model was trained on a set of red wines and evaluated on a hold-out test set (20%).

* **Test Data Accuracy:** [**Run notebook to get score**]

This initial accuracy score provides a strong validation of the Random Forest approach for this classification task.

## Strategic Roadmap: WQC Evolution

The successful deployment of V1.0 requires refinement and integration planning:

1.  **Feature Importance Analysis:**
    * **Action:** Leverage the Random Forest's inherent ability to determine feature importance. We must quantify *which* chemical metrics (e.g., alcohol, sulfites) are driving the final quality score to provide actionable insights back to our winemaking and sourcing teams.
2.  **Model API Deployment:**
    * **Action:** Operationalize the WQC as a RESTful API (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI). This will allow other internal systems (Inventory Management, QA Testing Rigs) to submit new chemical profiles and receive instant quality predictions.
3.  **Advanced Model Iteration (WQC v2.0):**
    * **Action:** Evaluate the performance of other models tested in the notebook (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression) as potential alternatives, particularly if V1.0 struggles with highly imbalanced data (Good vs. Bad quality split).
4.  **Threshold Sensitivity:**
    * **Action:** Analyze model performance at different quality thresholds (e.g., $Q \geq 6$). Understanding the trade-offs in classifying borderline quality wines is crucial for maximizing
